It is possible to have RGBA (rgb color and an alpha channel) backgrounds in modern browsers -- as well as Internet Explorer 7 and 8. This less mixin makes that process a little less tedious.

--Setting up
Simply include ie-rgbabg.less in your LESS project via:

@import "path/to/ie-rgbabg.less";

Or just copy the contents out of ie-rgbabg.less and paste it right into your less file(s).

--Usage
ie-rgbab.less gives you a new mixin:

.mixin--rgbabg(@r, @g, @b, @a);

The arguments are self explanatory. If you would normally set a background like so:

.selector{
  background-color: rgba(255,138,0,.5);
}

You would now instead set your background like so:

.selector{
  .mixin--rgbabg(255,138,0,.5);
}

--Output
This mixin attempts to output the proper format for IE7 and 8, as well as regular old non-stupid rgba. The output of the above mixin would be:

.selector{
  background-color: rgba(255, 138, 0, 0.5);
  -ms-filter: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.gradient(startColorstr=#7FFF8A00,endColorstr=#7FFF8A00);
  filter: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.gradient(startColorstr=#7FFF8A00,endColorstr=#7FFF8A00);
  zoom: 1;
}
